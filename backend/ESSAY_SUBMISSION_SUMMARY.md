# Essay Question Submission Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented essay question submission functionality for the BECE platform. When users submit essay-type questions, they now receive a success message instead of immediate results, since essays require manual grading.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated `submit_bece_practice` View (`backend/bece/views.py`)
- **Detection**: Automatically detects if a paper contains essay questions
- **Different Processing**: 
  - Essay questions: Saves text answers, marks as pending grading
  - Multiple choice: Processes normally with immediate scoring
- **Response Handling**: Returns different responses based on question type

### 2. Enhanced `BECESubmissionSerializer` (`backend/bece/serializers.py`)
- **Flexible Input**: Accepts both `answer_id` (multiple choice) and `text_answer` (essay)
- **Validation**: Ensures proper answer format for different question types

### 3. Database Storage
- **Essay Answers**: Stored in `BECEUserAnswer.text_answer` field
- **Grading Status**: `is_correct=False` and `marks_earned=0` initially
- **Manual Grading**: Ready for instructor review and scoring

## Response Format
