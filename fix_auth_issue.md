# Fix Authentication Issue

## Problem
The user is getting 403 Forbidden errors because they have an invalid or missing authentication token.

## Quick Fix
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Find localStorage
4. Delete the 'authToken' entry
5. Refresh the page and log in again

## Alternative Fix (JavaScript Console)
Run this in the browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
window.location.reload();
```

## What Happened
The user account was created but the authentication token wasn't properly generated or stored. The login process will create a new token.

## Backend Fix Applied
I've already created a token for the user 'awuleynovember@gmail.com' in the database, but the frontend needs to get the new token by logging in again.
